# earthquakes-leaflet.js
- Used a week's worth of GeoJSON earthquake datafrom the United States Geological Survey (USGS). (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)
- Created a map with different tile layers using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude.
- Data markers reflect earthquake size and color and information pops up when clicked.
- Includes a timeline feature.
- Created an additional heatmap and cluster map, using Leaflet plugins.
- Deployed to GitHub Pages: https://vtyeh.github.io/earthquakes-leaflet.js/index.html
